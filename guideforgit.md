## Guide for useful git commands and general basic usage

**gh clone repo user/repo_name** - download repo locally with git configuration  

**git add filename** - stage file(s) for a commit (*use . to denote all files in the directory*)  

**git restore --staged filename** - unstage file(s) for a commit  

**git-status** - list status of staged files and some brief information such as if the file has been modified or is a new file etc.  

**git commit -m " "** - commit staged git files with a message containing a descriptor of the nature of the commit (*e.g. "fixed a markdown header"*)  

**git log** - view a log of commits with commit ID, author, date and attached message

**git log --oneline** - view a log of commits in a shorthand format (*this purely displays a shortened ID and the associated message*)
